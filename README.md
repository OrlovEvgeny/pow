# Proof of work (PoW) implementation

![img.png](.docs/img.png)


### Quick start

```shell
PRIVATE_KEY=private-key docker-compose up
```

### How was implement Hashcash for TCP wolf pack server

#### Challengeâ€“response protocol

#### Why did I choose hashcash
- it's quite simple and fast than puzzle and many others

#### Hashcash Segments Explained
